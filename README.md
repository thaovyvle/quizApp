# The Quiz App

# Project Task:

Create a React Native project with three components and at least 3 screens in an independent repository.

• The three components should be used at least twice across the application with different parameters or route data (e.g. parameters, route params, etc).

• At least one state should be manipulated in a component (no static text or images or elements).

• Each component must also contain some user interface element that changes the state in some way.

​

# My Approach:

I created a new React Native project called the Quiz App. I implemented a login and registration screen requiring inputs and form validation. I also designed the app's home screen to display different quiz types as buttons. The quiz types will be multiple choice, multi-answer, true or false, math problems, and fill in the blank. All the quizzes will have a summary screen at the end to display the correct answers and the user’s tallied score.
